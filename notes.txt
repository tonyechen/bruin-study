To clone and connect to the github repo:

	git clone https://github.com/tonyechen/bruin-study.git

(do this inside the folder you want to clone the repo into)

To start working on the project:
1. good practice to do your implementation on a separate branch other 
   than main (the master branch that should only contain the latest working version of the codes):

To start a new branch:
	
	git branch <branch-name>

Go to your branch:
	
	git checkout <branch-name>

2. Be sure to merge changes from the main branch onto your branch before adding new codes to avoid conflicts:
First make sure the main branch is up-to-date on your local machine:
To update main branch:
	
	git pull origin main

To get changes from main, be sure to be in your branch:

	git merge main

**Subnote: To work on a branch that someone else started:
Pull the branch from github:
	
	git pull origin <branch-name>

3. To push your changes to github:
First you can use the following command to record changes that you made:

	git add .	(can replace . with specific file name, '.' record all changes)

After making and recording some changes, you need to commit the changes, make sure to add a message as all commits require you to do so:

	git commit -m "some messages"

**good practice to commit changes for a specific task together so it is easier to track and revert later

Finally, you can push the commit to github:

	git push origin <current-branch-your-on>


*** I suggest you download a GUI to track git commits, I use SourceTree
