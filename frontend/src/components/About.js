                    Bruin-Study is a full-stack web app developed for Computer Science 35L at University of California, Los Angeles.
                    <br></br>It was developed as a social platform to allow for students at UCLA to find and contact fellow students
                    that are taking or have taken the same classes as them. In this way students can easily find classmates to form study
                    groups with.
