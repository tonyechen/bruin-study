# Steps to start the Bruin Study application:
1. Create two split terminals that are both within the directory with this README.md file

2. For simplicity sake, we will denote one of terminals as the backend terminal and another as the frontend terminal

3. Within the Backend Terminal, enter the the 'backend' directory and run "npm install" to install all necessary dependencies for the backend of the project. After npm finish installing all the dependencies, run "npm start" to start the backend server. The terminal should display a message saying "Listening on port 5000...." once all the processes finish. 

This code block does it all:
````
cd backend && npm install && npm start
````

4. Switch over to the Frontend Terminal, enter the 'frontend' directory and run "npm install" to install all necessary dependencies for the frontend of the project. After npm finish installing all the dependencies, run "npm start" to start the frontend react app. The web application should automatically pop up when all the processes finish.

This code block does it all:
````
cd frontend && npm install && npm start
````
