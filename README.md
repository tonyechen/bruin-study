Steps to start the Bruin Study application:
1. Create two split terminals that are both within the directory with this README.md file
2. For simplicity sake, we will denote one of terminals as the backend terminal and another as the frontend terminal
3. Within the Backend Terminal, enter the the 'backend' directory and run "npm install" to install all necessary dependencies for the backend of the project.
4. Switch over to the Frontend Terminal, enter the 'frontend' directory and run "npm install" to install all necessary dependencies for the frontend of the project.
5. Within the the Backend Terminal and the 'backend' directory, run 'npm start' and within your terminal it should display a message saying "Listening on port 5000"
6. Within the Frontend Terminals and the 'frontend' directory, run 'npm start' and the web page should begin on your default browser
